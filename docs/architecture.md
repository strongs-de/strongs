# Architecture

## Shape of the thing

A SvelteKit app talking to PostgreSQL, served by Node behind Coolify's proxy. Reading and search pages
are server-rendered; the study sidebar and the admin import wizard are the only parts that fetch on
their own.

```
src/lib/bible/      domain logic, no I/O: books, references, Strong's ids, morphology, parsers
src/lib/server/     database, repositories, importers, auth, mail
src/lib/components/ Svelte components
src/routes/         pages and endpoints
scripts/            CLI: migrate, seed, import, prepare the e2e database
drizzle/            generated migrations plus three hand-written ones
data/               source files for the bundled translations and dictionaries
```

`src/lib/bible/` never imports from `src/lib/server/`. That is what lets the parsers and the reference
grammar be unit-tested without a database, and it keeps the rule "domain logic does not know where
data comes from" enforceable by looking at the imports.

## Data model

The interesting decisions:

**The canonical book list is code, not data.** `src/lib/bible/books.ts` holds all 66 books; `book_id`
is a plain integer with a check constraint. One source of truth, and no join on a chapter read. Book
names and their aliases live in `book-names.ts` for the same reason — the reference parser needs them
on every URL.

**Verse text is stored twice, on purpose.** `verses.segments` is structured JSON — plain runs, words
carrying Strong's numbers, footnotes, emphasis — and `verses.text` is the flattened form. The reader
renders segments directly, so there is no HTML parsing at request time and no way for imported text to
inject markup. Search uses `text`.

**`verse_words` has one row per Strong-tagged word.** About 750,000 rows for the bundled translations.
It is what turns "every place this word occurs" and "how does this translation render it" into ordinary
SQL. A word carrying several numbers — German writes "sechshundert" as `str="8337-H3967"` — produces one
row per number, sharing a position.

**Derived data is materialised.** `strong_stats`, `strong_glosses` and `search_terms` are materialised
views refreshed after an import. The previous version recomputed the gloss frequencies in Python on
every sidebar open, over every verse containing the word.

## Search

`verses.search_vector` is a generated `tsvector` over a `german_unaccent` configuration: German
snowball stemming plus accent folding.

Two details are worth knowing before changing anything here:

- A generated column may only call immutable functions, and `unaccent()` is merely stable. Hence the
  named configuration: `to_tsvector('german_unaccent', text)` with the configuration spelled out _is_
  immutable. `to_tsvector('german', unaccent(text))` is rejected.
- `phraseto_tsquery` discards stopwords, so `"am Anfang"` reduces to `'anfang'`. Quoted searches
  therefore use the tsquery to narrow candidates through the index and confirm the literal sequence
  with a word-boundary regex over `text`.

The stemmer does not strip participle prefixes, so a search for `lieb` does not reach `geliebt`. This is
covered by a test that documents it rather than asserts around it. Installing a German hunspell
dictionary would fix that and add compound splitting (`Menschensohn` → `Mensch` + `Sohn`), at the cost of
a custom PostgreSQL image.

## Importing

Parsers are async generators emitting a flat event stream (`metadata`, `verse`, `warning`, …), so memory
stays flat whether the upload is 1 MB or 100 MB, and progress can be reported while reading. Ingesters
consume the stream in batches. See [importing.md](importing.md) for the formats and their quirks.

The admin UI and `pnpm data:import` share the same dispatcher (`src/lib/server/import/index.ts`), so the
two cannot drift apart.

Imports run in the background because a full translation takes half a minute. The runner is in-process
and serial — imports happen a few times a year, and a queue service would be more moving parts than the
problem deserves. A job interrupted by a restart is marked failed at boot, not resumed.

## Caching

Public pages send `s-maxage` so a CDN can hold them; pages for a signed-in reader send `private,
no-store`, because they contain that person's verse lists. The list of resources is cached in-process
for 30 seconds and invalidated on admin writes.

## What is deliberately absent

- **No queue service, no Redis.** Sessions, throttling and jobs are PostgreSQL rows.
- **No client-side router state for the reader.** Chapter navigation is ordinary links; the browser and
  the server agree on the URL.
- **No verse-level HTML in the database.** Structure in, structure out.
