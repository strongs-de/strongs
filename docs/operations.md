# Operations

## Deploying

`compose.yaml` is the whole stack: the app and PostgreSQL 17. Add it in Coolify as a **Docker
Compose** resource, assign a domain to the `app` service, and set:

| Variable                    | Where it comes from                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES` | Coolify generates it; shared by app and database                        |
| `SERVICE_BASE64_64_SESSION` | Coolify generates it; signs session cookies                             |
| `SERVICE_BASE64_64_BACKUP`  | Coolify generates it; encrypts the S3 secret key set in `/admin/backup` |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`             | Brevo; without it, mails are written to the log instead of sent         |
| `MAIL_FROM`                 | must be a sender Brevo has verified                                     |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`     | the first account registered with this address becomes an admin         |

Migrations run in the container's entrypoint before the server starts, so a deploy that changes the
schema needs nothing extra. A failed migration stops the boot, and the healthcheck keeps the old
container serving.

### First deployment

1. Deploy. The site comes up with no translations and says so.
2. Register with the address in `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`; that account gets the admin role.
3. Import through `/admin/import`, or from a checkout with `pnpm data:import` against the production
   `DATABASE_URL`.

## Backups

Backup and restore live in the admin UI at `/admin/backup` (admins only) — there is no separate
sidecar container. The app shells out to `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` itself, so the runtime image includes
a matching `postgresql-client-17` (see the `Dockerfile`).

**Manual download**: "Backup herunterladen" dumps the database (`pg_dump --format=custom`) and streams
it straight to the browser — nothing is retained on the server afterwards.

**Scheduled S3 backup**: configurable per instance — endpoint, region, bucket, path prefix, access
key/secret (the secret is encrypted at rest with `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, never stored in plain text),
a schedule preset (hourly/daily/weekly + time of day) and retention (how many dumps to keep in the
bucket, and how many to additionally keep in the local `backups` volume as a safety net if S3 is
unreachable). A minute-granularity in-process scheduler checks whether a run is due; every run — manual
or scheduled — becomes a row in the "Verlauf" history, so "did last night's backup work" is answerable
without a shell.

**Restore**: uploads a `.dump` file and requires typing a confirmation phrase — both checked
server-side, not just by the disabled button. Before anything is touched, an automatic safety dump of
the current state is taken (locally, and to S3 if configured); if that safety dump fails, the restore
does not proceed. After a successful `pg_restore`, pending migrations are re-applied (a dump taken
before a schema change restores the old schema), the Strong's statistics materialized views are
refreshed (their data is not part of a dump), and caches are invalidated. The admin's own session may
no longer exist in the restored data — a fresh login can be necessary afterwards.

Only logical dumps are covered here (no point-in-time recovery). If the acceptable data-loss window
ever needs to be tighter than "since the last scheduled dump", the upgrade path is continuous WAL
archiving (`pgBackRest`/`wal-g`) — a bigger change, out of scope for now.

Verifying the S3 path works — worth doing once now rather than for the first time in an emergency: fill
in the S3 fields in `/admin/backup` and click "Verbindung testen", which writes and deletes a marker
object (proving write access, not just reachability), then "Jetzt sichern" and confirm the run appears
as "fertig" in the history and the object shows up under "Im Bucket vorhanden".

Only user data is irreplaceable. Translations can be re-imported from their source files, which is why
uploads are archived in the `uploads` volume — back that up too, or keep the sources elsewhere.

## Upgrading

**Application**: push, and Coolify redeploys. Migrations run on boot.

**PostgreSQL major version**: the data directory is not compatible across major versions, so dump,
recreate and restore:

```sh
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U strongs -Fc strongs > strongs.dump
docker compose down
docker volume rm strongs_pgdata     # only after checking the dump is complete
# raise the image version in compose.yaml, then
docker compose up -d db
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U strongs -d strongs --clean --if-exists < strongs.dump
docker compose up -d
```

## When something is wrong

**The site returns 503 and the healthcheck fails.** `/healthz` executes a query, so this means the
database is unreachable: `docker compose logs db`, `docker compose ps`.

**An import sits at "running".** It was interrupted by a restart. Jobs in that state are marked failed at
the next boot; restart the app container and retry the import.

**A translation reads oddly after an import.** Look at the warnings on the job in `/admin/import` first —
duplicated verses and unusable Strong's references are reported there. Then reimport: the original upload
is kept, so the same file can be run again from `/admin`.

**Search returns nothing for a word that is definitely there.** The vocabulary and statistics views are
refreshed after an import; if one was interrupted they can be stale. "Statistiken neu berechnen" on
`/admin/resources` rebuilds them and runs `ANALYZE`.

**Logins are refused with "Zu viele Versuche".** The throttle allows 8 failures per account and 30 per
address in 15 minutes, and rows age out on their own. To clear it immediately:
`delete from login_attempts;`.

**Someone cannot receive the reset mail.** `/admin/users` issues a one-time link and shows it on screen.

**A backup or restore sits at "läuft".** Same story as an import: it was interrupted by a restart, and
is marked failed at the next boot. Retry from `/admin/backup`.

**A scheduled backup fails with "`pg_dump` ist ... nicht installiert".** The runtime image is missing
`postgresql-client-17` — check the `Dockerfile`'s PGDG install step survived a recent change.

**A scheduled backup fails to reach S3.** "Verbindung testen" in `/admin/backup` reports the
underlying error (wrong endpoint, expired credentials, a bucket policy that allows read but not
write).

## Log lines worth alerting on

Logs are JSON on stdout, collected by Coolify.

- `"slow request"` — a request over 500 ms, with its path. A handful during an import is expected;
  a steady stream means a query has lost its index.
- `"import failed"` — with the reason.
- `"backup failed"` / `"restore failed"` — with the reason; check `/admin/backup` for the full error.
- `"mail not sent: BREVO_API_KEY is not configured"` — password resets are silently not arriving.
