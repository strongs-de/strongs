About
=====
We host the source code of the bible study page www.strongs.de. We want to give it away, cause we want you to contribute and we want to support your ideas and projects that will give people the opportunity to study the word of god.

Until now this site is only available in german. We do have the aim (and we have many other great ideas) to support other languages as well, but this is a question how it is requested by our users.


Quick-Start
===========

>- Install python and django if you don't have already
- Download the source code
- Change into main repo directory (the directory with the **manage.py** file in it)
- Execute the syncDb command:
```python manage.py syncDb```
- Start the Website:
```python manage.py runserver```
- Go to http://localhost:8000/initDb. This may take about 1 hour to generate the database
- Note: This generation process will be simplified through prepared databases you can download as release-package


Bible-Licenses
===================
Due to licensing restrictions we are not allowed to include the bible translations for **Schlachter 2000** and **Neue Genfer Ãœbersetzung**. The functionality to import these files is available and we have included it in our live site at www.strongs.de but it is not available nor part of this repo.
