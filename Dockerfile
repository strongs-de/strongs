# No USER here: the container starts as root so it can fix ownership of the mounted volumes, then

# `backups` specifically — that volume is reused from the old backup sidecar (see compose.yaml),
# which wrote to it as a different user, so a fresh deploy inherits a directory `node` cannot write
# to until this runs. `chown` on the directories themselves is enough (not `-R`): creating or
# deleting entries only needs write access to the containing directory, not ownership of the files
# already in it. `setpriv` execs directly into the target process — no wrapper left as PID 1 — so
# this changes nothing about how the server receives signals once it is running.
# Migrations run in the entrypoint rather than at image build time: they need the live database.
